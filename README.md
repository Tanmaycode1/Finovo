# Finovo- Our website provides both Investor as well as the StartUp a interactive and productive interface to develop a comprehensive financial management solution.


For the StartUp- We have the prediction models:

First: Predicts the valuation of the Company to get the funding they can raise based on their valuation.
Second: Our second prediction model finds certain ratios using the finances spent on R&D, Marketing, Administration along with profit to calculate whether a company will do well in the future or not  along with its probabilty.

For the Investor:
Provides the interactive frontend, that helps them invest in the StartUps based on their Financials and the growth of the Company through the verified documents and our prediction model, that they can see per startup as a viewer or by using it using StartUp's financials.

If the investor is interested for the same and want to talk to StartUp for the further process , he can reach out through general template mail also, in case they are not able to join physically, they can even use VR meetings for further discussions.


All the mailing system is by default, and the otp verification along with physical verification of ducuments like GSTIN, Tax Invoice,etc.
